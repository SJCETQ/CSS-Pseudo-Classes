        <p>An anchor element has four states:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>link:</b> when the link has not yet been clicked.</li>
            <li><b>visited:</b> when the link has been clicked (clicking a link "visits" that linked page, hence the name "visited").</li>
            <li><b>hover:</b> When the mouse is hovered over the link.</li>
            <li><b>active:</b> for the moment the mouse is clicked down on the link</li>
        </ul>
